Things to do:

	* Allow a user to perform tasks like "4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4+4"
	* record the last number in the display before closing
		and reopen with this number displayed.
			-(Most likely by adding and replacing tempMem every step, then saving to a file.
				This file would need to be loaded upon startup if it exists.)
	* Add RM & M+ functionality.
	* Fully comment throughout code.
